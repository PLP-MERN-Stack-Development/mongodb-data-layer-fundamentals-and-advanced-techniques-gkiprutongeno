# üìö MongoDB Data Layer Fundamentals ‚Äì PLP Bookstore

This project demonstrates MongoDB fundamentals and advanced techniques by building a **Bookstore database** (`plp_bookstore`) with a `books` collection.  
It covers CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing for performance optimization.

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Insert Sample Data
Run the provided script to insert 10+ book documents:

```bash
node insert_books.js
This will connect to your MongoDB instance (local or Atlas), drop any existing books collection, and reinsert the sample data.

2. Run Queries
All MongoDB queries are stored in queries.js.

Option 1: Load inside mongosh
bash
Copy code
mongosh "your-connection-string"
> load("queries.js")
Option 2: Run directly with mongosh
bash
Copy code
mongosh "your-connection-string" --file queries.js
Replace "your-connection-string" with your Atlas URI, e.g.:

bash
Copy code
mongosh "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster-url/plp_bookstore"
